# Hello Godot Mono: Snake

"Godot Engine - .NET", also known as "Godot Mono", has C# support. And frankly I'm sicking of learning new languages, so here we are!

This project takes heavy inspiration and code snippets from [Beginner Godot Tutorial - Make a Snake Game in 10 Minutes! by Coding With Russ - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlRP-UBR-2A).

This project uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)
